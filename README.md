## User Story
As a recent graduate of Coding Bootcamp, I want to be able to keep a list of educational tasks to complete to enhance my coding skills. I want to be able to add tasks, check-off tasks as completed, or delete tasks from the list so that I donâ€™t fall behind on my coding knowledge.

## Description
This is our group project for Project 3 created in the UW Coding Bootcamp. This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) app that will allow a user to access a dashboard with their to-do list for keeping their educational goals. This app also utilizes bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, and bootstrap.

## Installation
- Download it through Github
- Run npm i in terminal to install packages
- Running npm run develop will give you access to the Apollo Server (Graph QL), MongoDB Compass,  and the localhost webpage
